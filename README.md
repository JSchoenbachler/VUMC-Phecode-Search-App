Given the following Guidelines:


1. Using the 3 .csv files given write a full stack solution that allow the user to fetch associated icd9 codes from a phecode. The interface and how the user interacts with the page to receive the related information is up to you. 

2. Use whatever technologies you are most comfortable with. 

3. Be creative and make the app look and function good as you can with as many features, bells, and whistles as you want to show your skills.

4. Deploy the app using a hosting service of your choice and send an email to {assessment provider email here} containing a link to the app, GitHub repo and a .zip file of the project.

5. We are hoping to hear back from you within a week.

This application allows for searching of ICD9 Codes to find related phecodes. I have added some additional functionality past what was asked, usch as:

1. Exact Matching
2. Reverse Search
